# data science projects
Code produced from Springboard bootcamp. Code is organized in 4 folders: 
1. Capstone 1 (now a separate repository called “cryptocurrency_statistical_arbitrage”)
2. Capstone 2 (now a separate repository called “hiphop_decade_classification”)
3. Mini Projects- cells labled "CL" are my own work and green boxes are my answers to the exercise questions
4. etc- additional projects outside of curriculum
